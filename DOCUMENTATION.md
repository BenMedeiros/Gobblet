## Core Components

### 1. Game Engine (`src/gobblet/`)

#### Board (`board.py`)
- Implements 4x4 game board with piece stacking
- Handles piece placement and movement validation
- Win condition detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Position querying and board state management

#### Game (`game.py`)
- Main game loop and turn management
- Move execution and validation
- Game state tracking and termination conditions
- Integration with move tracking system

#### Pieces (`piece.py`)
- Three piece sizes: Small (1), Medium (2), Large (3)
- Two colors: Light and Dark
- Covering rules: larger pieces can cover smaller pieces
- Unique piece identification system

#### Players (`player.py`)
- **RandomPlayer**: Makes random valid moves
- **GreedyPlayer**: Prioritizes winning moves and blocking opponent wins
- **DefensivePlayer**: Focuses on board control and defensive positioning
- Extensible architecture for adding new strategies

#### Move Tracking (`moves.py`)
- Comprehensive move recording with timestamps
- Game session management and data persistence
- JSON serialization for data analysis
- Performance metrics and game statistics

#### Simulator (`simulator.py`)
- Single game simulation with detailed results
- Batch simulation with parallel processing support
- Tournament system for strategy comparison
- Performance monitoring and statistics

### 2. Analysis System (`analysis/`)

#### Move Analyzer (`move_analyzer.py`)
- Opening move pattern analysis
- Positional preference tracking
- Capture pattern analysis
- Move frequency heatmaps
- Strategy-specific move patterns

*Note: Requires pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for full functionality*

#### Strategy Analyzer (`strategy_analyzer.py`)
- Strategy effectiveness measurement
- Head-to-head matchup analysis
- Strategy characteristic profiling
- Learning curve analysis
- Performance recommendations

### 3. Command-Line Interface (`main.py`)

Comprehensive CLI with support for:
- Single and batch simulations
- Tournament execution
- Data analysis and visualization
- Configurable parameters
- Parallel processing options

## Installation and Setup

### Basic Installation
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd Gobblet

# Install basic dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Full Installation (with analysis)
```bash
# Install all dependencies including analysis tools
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Or install as a package
pip install -e .
```

## Usage Examples

### Command-Line Usage

```bash
# Run a simple simulation
python main.py --games 50 --verbose

# Run a tournament
python main.py --tournament --tournament-games 20

# Compare specific strategies
python main.py --games 100 --light-strategy greedy --dark-strategy defensive

# Run with parallel processing
python main.py --games 1000 --parallel

# Analyze existing data
python main.py --analyze --data-file data/games.json

# Generate analysis plots
python main.py --analyze --save-plots results/
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from src.gobblet.simulator import GameSimulator
from src.gobblet.moves import GameDataManager

# Create simulator
data_manager = GameDataManager("my_games.json")
simulator = GameSimulator(data_manager)

# Run simulations
results = simulator.run_batch_simulation(
    num_games=100,
    light_strategy="greedy",
    dark_strategy="defensive"
)

# Analyze results
print(f"Win rate: {results['light_win_rate']:.1%}")
```

## Strategy Implementations

### Random Strategy
- Selects moves randomly from all valid options
- Baseline for comparison with other strategies
- Uniform distribution over possible moves

### Greedy Strategy
- Prioritizes immediate winning moves
- Blocks opponent winning moves
- Prefers center positions and larger pieces
- Uses tactical move evaluation

### Defensive Strategy
- Focuses on board control and position
- Prioritizes blocking over attacking
- Controls strategic positions (corners, center)
- Conservative piece usage

## Data Format

Game data is stored in JSON format with complete move histories:

```json
{
  "game_id": "uuid",
  "start_time": "ISO datetime",
  "end_time": "ISO datetime", 
  "winner": "light|dark|null",
  "moves": [
    {
      "player_color": "light|dark",
      "move_type": "place|move",
      "piece_id": 1,
      "piece_size": 1-3,
      "from_position": [row, col] or null,
      "to_position": [row, col],
      "captured_piece_id": id or null,
      "move_number": 1,
      "timestamp": "ISO datetime"
    }
  ],
  "player_strategies": {
    "light": "strategy_name",
    "dark": "strategy_name"
  },
  "total_moves": 42,
  "game_duration_seconds": 1.23
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

Based on benchmarking:
- Single games: ~100-500 games/second (depending on strategy complexity)
- Parallel processing: 2-4x speedup on multi-core systems
- Memory usage: ~0.5-1 KB per game for data storage
- Tournament with 3 strategies, 100 games each: ~5-10 seconds

## Testing

Run tests manually or with pytest:

```bash
# Manual testing
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from gobblet.board import Board
print('Basic functionality test passed!')
"

# With pytest (if installed)
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Demo and Benchmarking

```bash
# Run interactive demo
python demo.py

# Run performance benchmark
python benchmark.py
```

## Extension Points

The architecture supports easy extension:

1. **New Strategies**: Inherit from `Player` class in `player.py`
2. **Custom Analysis**: Extend analyzers in `analysis/`
3. **Different Board Sizes**: Configurable in game initialization
4. **New Game Variants**: Modify rules in `board.py` and `game.py`

## License

This project is open source. See LICENSE file for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure `src/` is in Python path
2. **Analysis Not Available**: Install pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
3. **Slow Performance**: Use parallel processing with `--parallel` flag
4. **Memory Issues**: Process games in smaller batches

### Performance Tips

1. Use parallel processing for large simulations
2. Save data periodically during long runs
3. Use smaller board sizes for faster games
4. Consider memory usage for very large datasets

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Machine learning strategy implementations
- Web interface for visualization
- Database backend for large datasets
- Real-time strategy adaptation
- Neural network player training
- Advanced statistical analysis tools
